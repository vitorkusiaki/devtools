This repo is going to be used as a backup of my programming environment. You may not agree with some of the tools I use, but I feel comfortable about them.

Also, I would like to know what *you* use and why! Feel free to comment, complain, cry or whatever!


I use Linux distros. At the moment, I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bits)
